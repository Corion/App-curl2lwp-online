# NAME

App::curl2lwp::online - convert curl and JS fetch() commands to Perl code online

# DESCRIPTION

This is the code driving [https://corion.net/curl2lwp.psgi](https://corion.net/curl2lwp.psgi). It is a fancy web
interface to [HTTP::Request::FromCurl](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Request::FromCurl) and [HTTP::Request::FromFetch](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Request::FromFetch)
using [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious) for the web frontend.

It allows code generation for
[LWP::UserAgent](https://metacpan.org/pod/LWP::UserAgent) and [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny). While [HTTP::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Tiny) is smaller
and supports fewer protocols, it comes included with every modern Perl already.

This module is a placeholder to allow installation via `cpan`.

# INSTALLATION

Copy the included `curl2lwp.cgi` and `fetch2lwp.cgi` command to somewhere
where your webserver can invoke it.

Alternatively, launch the program as

    curl2lwp.cgi daemon

to launch it with the Mojolicious webserver.
