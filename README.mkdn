# NAME

App::curl2lwp::online - convert curl commands to LWP::UserAgent Perl code online

# DESCRIPTION

This is the code driving [https://corion.net/curl2lwp.psgi](https://corion.net/curl2lwp.psgi). It is a fancy web
interface to [HTTP::Request::FromCurl](https://metacpan.org/pod/HTTP::Request::FromCurl) using [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious) for the
web frontend.

This module is a placeholder to allow installation via `cpan`.

# INSTALLATION

Copy the included `curl2lwp.cgi` command to somewhere where your webserver
can invoke it.

Alternatively, launch the program as

    curl2lwp.cgi daemon

to launch it with the Mojolicious webserver.
