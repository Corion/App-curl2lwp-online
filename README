App::curl2lwp::online - convert curl and JS fetch() commands to Perl code online

DESCRIPTION

This is the code driving L<https://corion.net/curl2lwp.psgi>. It is a fancy web
interface to L<HTTP::Request::FromCurl> and L<HTTP::Request::FromFetch>
using L<Mojolicious> for the web frontend.

It allows code generation for
L<LWP::UserAgent> and L<HTTP::Tiny>. While L<HTTP::Tiny> is smaller
and supports fewer protocols, it comes included with every modern Perl already.

This module is a placeholder to allow installation via C<cpan>.
